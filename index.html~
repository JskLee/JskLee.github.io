                <div>
			<p>&ensp; 
			I always dreamed of becoming a scientist since I was young, but I never knew that I would develop a passion for earth science.
			In 2018, I was a junior undergraduate student majoring in physics when I met Professor <a href="http://seismo.snu.ac.kr/people.html" target="_blank"><b>Junkee Rhie</b></a>, who introduced me to the science of earthquakes.
			I was soon intrigued by the inherently underdetermined problems of seismology, which required innovative ideas to take full advantage of the observations limited in both time and space.
			</p>
			<p>&ensp;During my Master's course, I numerically simulated the seismic wave propagation for large scenario earthquakes in the Korean Peninsula.
			I learned the limitations of kinematic rupture models, which often rely on ad-hoc constraints.
			Accounting for the earthquake model's physical plausibility (in terms of both validness and likelihood) may be the next problem in seismology that needs to be solved.
			</p>
			<p>&ensp; Broadly, I am interested in constraining earthquake rupture processes through physics-based modeling and data-driven approaches.
			I believe that characterizing the prior probability of physically viable earthquake ruptures will enable accurate predictive earthquake modeling and efficient dynamic source inversions.
			Identifying the multi-physics/multi-scale processes involved in the earthquake rupture - which include the effects of pore fluids (e.g. thermal pressurization), shear heating, material heterogeneity, complex fault geometry, fault roughness, and interaction between fault strands - seems to be the leading topic of the earthquake physics community.

			</p>
			<p>&ensp;I am currently searching for schools to apply for a Ph.D. course in Seismology/Geophysics.
			I am generally considering computational seismology as a potential field of study,
			yet I am also open to related fields including observational seismology, field seismology, and earthquake geodesy. </p> </div><!--//summary-->

		<div class="item"><div class="details"><p> &ensp;I perceive seismology as a study of identifying the mapping between the unknown earthquake source domain and the codomain of observables.
		Although the forward mapping - represented by the Green's functions - is deterministic in theory, some aspects of the map still remain unclear. The earthquake source process is ill-constrained, the available observations are limited, and the mapping functions are restricted by our knowledge about the Earth's structure and the seismic wave propagation.
		I believe that the relationship between the source domain and the observable range should be formulated probabilistically to account for both epistemic and aleatory uncertainties.
		In this sense, my research aimed to make a small contribution towards identifying the mapping through numerical modeling and statistical parametrization, albeit within a limited scope of frequency, magnitude, and region.</p>

		<h2 class="sub-title">3-D Seismic Wave Propagation</h2>
			    <div class="details"><p>
				    &ensp;In my publication Lee et al. (<i>in press</i>), I simulated the seismic waveforms for large (Mw > 5.4) earthquake scenarios in the southeastern Korean Peninsula, using pseudo-dynamic rupture models and a 3-D velocity model within a SEM-based framework (<u><a href="https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/specfem3d/" target="_blank">SPECFEM3D</a></u>).
		Ensembles of <a href="https://github.com/sgsong1017/SongRMG" target="_blank"><u>pseudo-dynamic rupture models</u></a> (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/204/2/1254/597744?login=true" target="_blank"><u>Song, 2016</u></a>), with correlation structures derived from a set of dynamic rupture models, were generated stochastically to emulate the unknown rupture process under physical constraints.
		300 different rupture models were generated for a fixed scenario magnitude, and each rupture model was convolved with the pre-calculated Green's functions at the discretized subfaults.
		Comparison of the aggregated peak ground velocity values to the observations of the 2016 Gyeongju earthquake demonstrated that the effects of surface-wave radiation, rupture directivity, and both local and regional amplifications from the 3-D wave propagation were reproduced accurately.</p>

				    <p>&ensp; This reseach was developed with guidance from Prof. <a href="https://seismology.korea.ac.kr/cv" target="_blank"><u>Seongryong Kim</u></a>, and is the first published work of 3-D physics-based ground motion simulations targeting the Korean Peninsula.
				    In the research process, I learned that the faith in numerical simulations can only be developed through rigorous verification and validation.
				    I had previously tested the reliability of 3-D wave propagation simulations with finite fault models (<a href="http://equake-rc.info/srcmod/" target="_blank">SRCMOD</a>)  of large historical earthquakes (e.g. 1946 Nankai, 2004 Fukuoka, 2016 Kumamoto) in my undergraduate research project (<a href="assets/data/InternReport.pdf" target="_blank"><u>1</u></a>, <a href="assets/data/NankaiEQ.pdf" target="_blank"><u>2</u></a>), which became the foundation for this study.
				I seek to develop my abilities as a researcher to appropriately formulate meaningful geophysical problems and interpret the implications of numerical simulations.

                    <div class="details">
			    <p>&ensp;
			    As a completion of my Master's thesis, I am aiming to extend the results of physics-based ground motion simulations to probabilistic seismic hazard analysis and provide estimates of possible structural damage.
			I am targeting large potential earthquakes in Northern Kyushu, which are in proximity to the Korean Peninsula and have high probabilities of rupture.
			Statistical estimations based on ground motion simulations of sampled pseudo-dynamic rupture models, may provide a rough probability distribution of possible peak ground motions at a site.
			Applications involving fragility curves of earthquake engineering may provide probabilistic predictions on the degree of structural damage being slight, moderate, or extensive.</p> 
			</p>
			<p>&ensp; I had been working on this research since my <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/514403" target="_blank">poster presentation</a> in AGU 2019.
			My other research project on the 2016 Gyeongju earthquake, which began later in 2020, happened to be published in advance in the process of validating the simulation framework.
			My Master's thesis under preparation, will be a combination of the two papers and will discuss from implementation of the simulation method, comparisons with the observations, and applications to earthquke engineering in its entireity.</p>

			<h2 class="sub-title">Modeling Prompt Elastogravity Signals</h2>
                    <div class="details">
			    <p> &ensp; For my undergraduate thesis in Physics, I studied the numerical modeling of gravity perturbations induced by earthquake rupture.
			    This research topic was prompted by a coffee talk with my friend <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Taehun-Kim-11" target="_blank"><b>Taehun Kim</b></a>, who studies gravitational physics.
			    We were having a conversation about interdisciplinary projects, when he told me that the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors were limited at low frequencies due to seismic noise.
			    I sensed a potential research topic and visited Professor <a href="https://physics.snu.ac.kr/en/research-faculty/faculty/fulltime?mode=view&profidx=5" target="_blank"><b>Sunghoon Jung</b></a> to discuss some ideas I had, which developed into this <u><a href="assets/data/PhysThesis.pdf" target="_blank">thesis paper</a></u> (<i>in Korean</i>).</p>
			<p>
			&ensp; Using the codes (by <u><a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=o4ERK9UAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Surendra Somala</a></u>) implemented in the SPECFEM3D software, I calculated the transient variation of gravity acceleration during and after the earthquake rupture, which is caused by the volumetric deformation carried by P waves.
			I succesfully reproduced the results of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/201/3/1416/763237" target="_blank"><u>Harms et al., (2015)</u></a>, which compared the numerical simulations of gravity perturbation in a homogeneous, elastic half-space with approximate analytic solutions.
			Although the application prospects of prompt gravity signals to early earthquake warning can be controversial, I find it meaningful that I have proactively searched and identified a unique interdisciplinary problem.
